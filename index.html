                <p>
                    In the few months I have been doing Web Development, I have already made dozens of websites, let it be static or dynamic.
                    I have already worked with Frontend languages like javascript, but also with server side stuff like php in connection with
                    a MySql database.

                <p>
                    I have been doing amateur video editing for almost two years on and off. I have edited multiple videos for school projects, 
                    but also montages for some of my best clips playing video games over this period of time.

                <h3>Software Development</h3>
                <hr><br>
                <p>
                    Software development is what I have been doing for the shortest time now, but I would consider myself being pretty
                    fluent in it. My main language at the moment is C#, somemtimes in connection with WinForms, but I've also started 
                    learning Python lately.

                    <p>
                        I love to program small or large projects in my freetime. I usually use Python and C# to do this, but lately I've also started 
                        doing some more things like WebDev.

                            use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, the possibilities are (almost) infinite.

                    I love to do two things: One is making people have fun with what I created. The other one is learning new 
                    things. I love programming. It is a passion of mine.
