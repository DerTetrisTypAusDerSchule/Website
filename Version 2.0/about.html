            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>
                Well, hello there. I am a 15 y/o dude from somewhere in Germany. I've always loved technology. It probably started 
                somewhere in primary school, where sometimes I would be allowed to play xBox with my brother. The first game I ever played myself though
                was probably Minecraft. I remember having to ask my brother how to jump or move, because I did not know how to do so. This went on
                for a few years, until in around sixth grade I got my very own laptop after begging my parents for something to play Minecraft on.
                I remember how at first I was really overwhelmed by everything and really only resorted to gaming. At around seventh grade, I started
                video editing, because of a school project. I was in a group of people that didn't know much about computers at all. So for some reason I
                volunteered to edit the video. It took me way too long, and now looking at it I still cringe really hard, but at that time I was
                really proud of it. Because of me having so much fun editing videos, I've started recording some of my highlights and even made two
                montages. The second of wich I still look at sometimes, because I'm still proud of it. As the time progressed, I started getting more
                and more interested in technology. But I still thought, that programming was something completely crazy, that only freaks and 
                geniuses were able to do. This didn't stop me from starting with a Python course at around christmas of 2018. Due to me not knowing 
                anything about programming, I was confused on why you would need variables and loops and things like that. After like four days I 
                got frustrated and stopped. So I started with Html, because after looking around on Youtube, I heard that with this you could 
                immediately bring stuff to the screen. This instantly hooked me. I remember the feeling I first used an &lt;a> tag to jump from one 
                page to another. I felt like a wizard. I made some progress and after around a month, I got passively pushed to C++, because I 
                wanted to actually "program". C++ was an okay language. It was the first time I realized, that the stuff I listed that before, 
                which I thought you did not need for programming was actually useful. I did my first few programs and for example made a text based 
                Rpg with around 600 lines of code, which I was really proud of. I actually learned a lot. But I thought to myself
                that I wanted to make games. I looked at Unreal Engine, and it felt too much like something only huge companies like Epic Games
                would use. So after around 2 months of C++ I switched to C#. I wanted to learn the basics of C# and then jump over to Unity. Up
                to now, this still didn't happen. I kinda got away from making games and wanted to build actual Useful stuff. Lately I've started 
                some more WebDev again, because I don't care if people think, that I'm not a real programmer, because I use Html and Css. I've been
                having a blast designing WebPages. I still sometimes wonder where my journey will take me.

                    I love to do two things: One is making people have fun with what I created. The other one is learning new 
                    things. I love programming. It is a passion of mine.
